ADVENT OF CODE!!!

My solutions to the 2022 AoC Challenge :christmas_tree:

Probably most of them will be in :snake:, maybe some in R, and if I'm extremely motivated, JavaScript.


:star: Days 1-4 are in :snake: 


:star: Day05 is in R :goat:

:star: Day06 is in JavaScript / React Component (you need to establish a React app to actually run it, but the JavaScript code inside should be readable for some)
